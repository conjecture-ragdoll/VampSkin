[Currently in development mode starting on October 22, 2021]


Never fear! Save time trying to plan when to do your next skincare ritual,
and instead plan it in advanced based on your own skin behaviors 
tracked around your menstralCycle. Have it ready just by the convenience of your Android phone.

Did you know our menstral cycle makes us vulnerable to side effects such as excess oilyness at certain times of the month? Or even dehydrated looking skin.  These changes can compramise our skin barrier, leading to acne or textured skin overall.

Sometimes working with the same skincare all throughout the month isn't the best for the healthiest skin. But thinking about 
it all the time can be stressful and take time away from our priorities.

Simply tap your symptoms for our program to learn how your skin behaves throughout the month.
Have a simple and customized routine with fewer and more potent actives that's right for your skin.
